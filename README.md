# snake
al-mun.github.io/snake

Simple snake game that I decided to try to recreate. Uses the arrow keys to control movement of snake. Every time it eats a fruit it increases in size.

Score is updated with each fruit eaten. 

Known bugs include:

-clicking start will increase rate at which snake moves.
-Occasionally the snake disappears into the space between the grid and the window.
